# AutonomousSpaceCraft
In this Project I have tried to evolve a virtual space craft, which will learn to safely land itself on a given landing pad. The location of the landing pad and the origin point of the SpaceCraft can be modified from the Code.
The Craft has three thrusters on the left, bottom and right side respectively. A thruster can be either ON or OFF . The craft moves in the 2D space using these thrusters.


There is a neural network associated with the craft , which will operate the thrusters on the basis of the current speed of the craft and its relative position to the landing pad. The Neural Network's weights will be modified by the Genetic Algorithm while the craft is learning .
